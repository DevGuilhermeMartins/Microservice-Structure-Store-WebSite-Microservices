# About Project

This is a microservices project comprising Product, Catalog, and Cambio microservices. The microservices contain a function to convert a product price in a specific currency. Each product has its catalog, allowing users to search within individual catalogs or across multiple catalogs associated with the product.

In addition, this microservice utilizes a Eureka server to host all microservices, along with a load balancer for efficient load distribution. It also features an API Gateway that simplifies the creation of routes for accessing the microservices.
